<h2>Abstract</h2>
The drawing bot, nicknamed <i>Stabbie</i> is easily controlled with a joystick. The purpose was to create a remotely operated robot arm capable of sustaining its head levelled at a fixed height throughout its operating range. This makes it possible to draw with even pressure using a pencil on a flat surface.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The task is to create an interacting robot which is judged on the basis of the following three criteria
<ul>
<li>Playfulness</li>
<li>Originality</li>
<li>Design and Implementation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Design specification</h2>
The user

<h2>Levelling the head</h2>
The head of the robotarm is levelled

<h2>Results</h2>
<i>Stabbie</i> performed well in all areas, even winning <i>Design and Implementation</i> with a score of 4.6 out of 5.
The overall assessment resulted in a score of 4.2 out of 5, resulting in a third place in the course competition.
